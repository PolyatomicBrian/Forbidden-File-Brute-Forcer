#Simple Dictionary Brute Forcer
# ~~ By Brian Jopling, 2016 ~~
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Purpose: To append words from a dictionary to the end of a URL in an attempt at
#         brute forcing to obtain forbidden files from a website.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Why was this created?
#I threw this together during the Steam Summer Sale of 2016 to help the community
#figure out whether or not Valve was hosting an ARG during the event.
